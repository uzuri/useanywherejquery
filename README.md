# Use Anywhere Slideshow

Originally written for Harvard SEAS, this slideshow is an expansion of the simplest jQuery slideshow http://snook.ca/archives/javascript/simplest-jquery-slideshow  Its goal is to provide an easily reusable slideshow with thumbnail navigation that can work with a very limited mark-up, allowing a non-technical user to easily build a slideshow in a typical WYSIWYG editor relatively simply.
